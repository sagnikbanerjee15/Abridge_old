# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

1. I have several RNA-Seq samples aligned to a reference which is no longer available. What should I do?
2. I aligned my RNA-Seq samples to a reference without the MD tag. How do I generate MD tag for `abrigde` compression?
3. How do I know that the compression is lossless?
4. I need to view only the references and not alignments. What command should I execute?
5. What is the correct command for viewing alignments without reference headers?
